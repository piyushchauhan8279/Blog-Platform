To understand what Flask is you have to understand a few general terms. 

WSGI Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) has been adopted as a standard for Python web application development.
WSGI is a specification for a universal interface between the web server and the web applications. 

Werkzeug It is a WSGI toolkit, which implements requests, response objects, and other utility functions. 
This enables building a web framework on top of it. The Flask framework uses Werkzeug as one of its bases.

jinja2 jinja2 is a popular templating engine for Python. 
A web templating system combines a template with a certain data source to render dynamic web pages.


SQLAlchemy ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a part of SQLAlchemy, which is a Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy ORM provides a way to interact with databases using Python objects, allowing developers to work with databases in a more object-oriented manner rather than dealing directly with SQL queries.

Here's how SQLAlchemy ORM typically works:

1. **Define Object-Relational Mapping**: Developers create Python classes that represent tables in the database. These classes are called ORM classes or simply models.

2. **Map Python Classes to Database Tables**: SQLAlchemy provides mechanisms to map these Python classes to database tables. This mapping is usually defined using declarative syntax, where classes inherit from a base class provided by SQLAlchemy.

3. **Interact with the Database**: Once the mapping is established, developers can use instances of these Python classes to interact with the database. They can create, read, update, and delete records using Python syntax, and SQLAlchemy automatically translates these operations into SQL queries.

4. **Querying Data**: SQLAlchemy provides a powerful query API that allows developers to build complex SQL queries using Python syntax. This API supports a wide range of operations such as filtering, sorting, joining, and aggregating data.

5. **Transaction Management**: SQLAlchemy ORM supports transaction management, allowing developers to perform multiple database operations within a single transaction. This ensures that either all operations succeed or none of them do, maintaining the integrity of the database.

Overall, SQLAlchemy ORM simplifies database interactions in Python applications by abstracting away the complexity of SQL queries and providing a more intuitive way to work with databases using Python objects. It is widely used in Python web frameworks like Flask and Django for database access and manipulation.
